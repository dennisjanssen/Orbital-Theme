# Orbital Theme
 A stellar theme for the Anbernic RG35XX
Contains a boot logo and a full theme. Might need some tweaks on your end for localisation and a decent list of games (depending on your game art).
See instructions below.

## Instructions
### Skin
Simply drag the skin, lang and font into the CFW folder on your SD card. It'll ask you to replace a bunch of files, hit yes.

### Boot logo
Replace the boot logo file in the misc partition

### RetroArch theme
Drag the retroarch folder into your CFW folder, it should merge the needed files too.
After booting your RG35XX, head into RetroArch/SETTINGS, then pick settings in the list. Select 'User interface', 'Appearance', set 'Menu color theme' to 'Custom' and then 'Custom Menu Theme Preset' to 'Orbital'. That should do it.

### Charging animation
Replace the ramdisk.img file in the misc partition and drag the entire battery folder in there too.
